### Session overview

Counting words is among the most common types of text analysis due to the fact that it is so simple and intuitively understandable. In the previous section we looked at how to create n-gram style graphs. In this session we will learn how to analyze words of interest in their context, so called "keyword in context" analysis. 

We then discuss total frequency word counts and in the process will consider frequent types of text preparation: stopword removal, stemming and lemmitization. We then consider ways to count words - individual words, n-grams and part-of-speech counting. 

We finish by looking at counting using dictionaries and dictionary-based sentiment analysis.
